# AsteroidClassificaton

*The Goal of this project is to Classify whether an asteroid is Hazadrous or not*

*Main Problem revolving around handling such large number of data,around 9 lakh rows . where acuuracy can be overlooked by sheer number of Non hazardous asteriods*

*Skilledly applied Feature Engineering and Data Visualization techniques to rescale a large dataset, reducing it from approximately 900,000 rows to a more manageable 25,000 rows, optimizing data quality and processing efficiency*

*Leveraged the rescaled dataset to identify critical attributes contributing to hazardous behaviors in asteroids, paving the way for improved classification models and risk assessment.*
